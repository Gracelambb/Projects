    "### Introduction\n",
    "All financial market performance in any company’s stocks are subject and vulnerable to the interest of investors and analysts. When one notices a company doing well in sales, a shareholder will most likely consider investing in such a company. Such as the rise in Tesla stocks purchased over the last years as it has become one of the most recognized brands of electrical vehicles in North America. However, a very intriguing set of stocks to observe is that of competitor companies, such as Samsung and Apple. It is not just a debate between users on which company produces better electronic products, but rather as two global leaders in the technology sector of products, these company's financial performance has often been a topic of speculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis, we try to find a relationship between the history of stock prices for both Samsung and Apple and note if there are any trends that could possibly be used to predict future trends for both companies that may assist in investment decisions. Our group would like to take a look at employment as a possible factor for a company's stock price as the observed generalization of how stocks change in price is all dependent on who is investing. That said, investors penalizing companies for layoffs is quite common, causing the stock of the company to decrease in value 1. All this said, an analysis of a relationship between stocks in these two companies as well as the trends in employment can be used to build a predictive model to determine the value of security in stock in either company. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the process of analyzing the relationship between these two stocks will involve gathering 10 years worth of price data from 2012-2022 and employing statistical methods to assess the strength of any correlation that is observed. We believe that retrieving data from 2012-2022 is acceptable because this decade-long data set will provide a substantial timeframe to observe patterns and fluctuations in both company’s stock prices. Not only that, but it is a significant point in time after the legal feud between Samsung and Apple in April of 2011 to which Apple had filed a lawsuit against Samsung for allegedly infringing on Apple’s designs and trademarks, eventually leading to Samsung countersuing 1. Therefore, this decade holds not just an opportunity to see stock changes after the announcement and release of products, but also marks the beginning of a clash between Samsung and Apple users and investors.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Prior Work\n",
    "\n",
    "In one piece of literature, it is explained that Apple and Samsung for the past 12 years have been in stiff competition with each other with Apple beginning the revolution with the release of the one of the first smartphones in 2007 with Samsung soon following since then, both companies constantly try to out-market each other. Although Apple outspends Samsung in its advertising for new products, Samsung’s creativity in campaigns has proven itself to be extraordinary 2. Because of this tension between the two companies, investors all keep a close eye on public reception of these two companies. In turn, heightening motivation from Apple and Samsung alike to innovate and pioneer a new lineage of technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our research on this topic, we came across the news that Apple announced the new release of M3 chips for MacBook Pro laptops and a new iMac model during a launch event Monday, October 30, 2023 3. The awaited news of significant enhancements in Apple’s software, such as longer battery life and amazing horsepower speeds for AI applications, has created so much buzz for the company that as of 1:52 PM EDT their stock had increased 0.21% to a stock price of 170.66 USD 4. Then when we take a look at the stock price for Samsung as of 3:30 PM KST, stock has decreased 0.59% to a stock price of about 49.46 USD per stock 5. Just from the stock changes we see overnight with Apple’s new announcement of upgrades, with Apple’s stocks increasing, Samsung’s decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is only a trend we see 17 hours after Apple’s announcement, we can see an inverse correlation between the two stock prices. It is also worth noting that competition between the two companies is also recognized by the public, which is made evident by the plethora of yahoo finance articles such as their article explaining the pros and cons of each company and admitting that the release cycles for Apple and Samsung “compliment each other”, but it is also recognized by the company themselves 6 .Their mutual lawsuits since 2011 have proven the companies’ constant battle to prove that the other either copies design or software, their most recent lawsuit being in May 2018 where the jury found Samsung to pay over $500 million for “slavishly” copying features on the iPhone 7. In May 2018, Apple’s stocks closed at 47.04 USD per share while Samsung’s closed at 37.99 USD. Again, we can see that as one stock increases the other decreases, here the decrease in stock price for Apple following their victory in their 2018 lawsuit against Samsung.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there was quite a change in the employment rates of these two companies when comparing them pre and post lawsuit settlement. From 2017 and going into the end of the lawsuit in 2018, Apple had an increase in employment of 7.32%. Then in 2019, a year after their victory, had another increase of 3.79%. (8) For Samsung, 2017 going into 2018 the rate of employment increased at 3.31%, however, post lawsuit in 2019 there was a significant decrease as the rate of employment plummeted to -10.67%.(9) Demonstrating that a year after the loss in the lawsuit of the May 2018 the settlement resulted in some investors thoughts faltered in the viability Samsung stocks which would also explain the decrease of the company’s stock price to a selling price of 32.34 USD and Apple’s decrease of price at a selling point price of 44.74 USD, nonetheless outweighing Samsung by a significant amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the movement of stock prices for these two companies could be coincidences, it is still a phenomenon that we are interested in exploring. The two occurrences presented don’t necessarily answer our question if the relationship is truly significant and if the changes in stock could be used to build a predictive model. In the first observation, Apple’s announcement of upgrades led to their increase in stock while Samsung’s decreased. In the second observation, Apple’s victory caused their stock price to decrease and Samsung’s to increase.While we are not here to track battles and tribulations between Apple and Samsung, we are here to determine if there is any kind of relationship between their stocks.\n",

    "We hypothesize that there will be a significant relationship between both Apple and Samsung stock markets, particularly an inverse correlation. When Apple’s stocks decrease by any amount Samsung’s will increase by any value, and vice versa. Due to this assumption, it is reasonable to believe that since either stock can fluctuate negatively or positively, both Samsung and Apple stock are reasonably secured to invest in. Positive employment rates usually indicate growth in the company and, in turn, the value of the company increases as well. Therefore, with the positive stock and/or employment rate increase, the company would be much more attractive to invest in. Thus, from an investor standpoint, since these two companies grow and fall inversely, the predictive model would suggest that at the peak of one company’s stock, it would be advantageous  to purchase stock from the rival company and vice versa. As mentioned, from just the two instances of fluctuations between the stock of Samsung and Apple it is seen that their association is quite opposite. Competitiveness is not usually about being equal with a rival, more often than not one aims to be better than the other. Seeing as Samsung and Apple have a history of lawsuits, we would assume that their relationship will not be parallel or positive.\n",

    "We do not have reason to believe that our data for stock prices would pose a privacy concern for investors. As for the datasets our group will create for Apple and Samsung stock, the data is simply a count of the amount of employees in each company and does not include factors such as race, gender, or wage. Simply, the datasets being created are only to note employment rates, which we believe would not be a concern for employee privacy. Moreover, we sourced this data from Kaggle, a reputable platform that provides access to a wide range of free public datasets. By using secondary data from this platform, we are confident that we have obtained our data with proper consent and in compliance with ethical standards. However, when working with publicly available data sets, we still put different ethical factors into consideration.There could also be some bias in that each data set might be more biased towards that certain company (i.e. apple users versus samsung users). The dataset for employment rates in both companies could pose some ethical bias. We sourced these datasets from two different websites that could potentially be the reason for this bias. Since these two sets were not originally in CSV form, the accuracy of the employment data is much lower than the stocks data sourced from Kaggle. \n",
    "\n",
    "The period we chose between (2012-2022) can introduce bias based on the economic events and trends during that specific time period. Market disruptions within those years can impact the analysis. The Apple stock dataset goes from 1980-2022 while the Samsung stocks go from 2000-2022, this might cause potential biases that we will have to dive deeper into when looking at our analysis. Another important concern to note is how the dataset was collected (i.e. what news source did the data come from) can also influence the reporting biases.\n",
    "Here we will explain how we will set out to detect specific biases before, during, and after communication in our analysis for this question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before analysis: We will conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the datasets we are working with and look for specific patterns or outliers while also checking for missing data. Then we would consider the years that the data were collected for both Apple and Samsung stocks, as well as employment, to assure the datasets we use represent our research analysis and what we are trying to uncover.\n",
    "\n",
    "During analysis: Our group will remain mindful of the trends in employment and trends in stock prices as we decide what to use and what to leave out for our conclusion while also taking into account the time period we are analyzing.\n",
    "\n",
    "After analysis: We will acknowledge the limitations we find in our analysis. By doing so, we will also be careful and conscious of the language and vocabulary used when conducting our analysis to ensure it does not exude bias towards one company.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamic nature of financial markets, specifically the stock market, is dynamic and can change quickly over time. It is important to consider the implications of using historical data to make predictions about future trends, especially in evolving markets. Historical data can also reflect biases or inaccuracies that were present at the time of collection so we should acknowledge and address these potential sources of bias. We will ensure the algorithms used do not perpetuate or amplify existing biases. In this case, it would be apple users versus samsung users. How we interpret and communicate our analysis can have ethical implications so it is essential that we are clear about the limitations of our analysis and avoid overgeneralizing claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do a comprehensive assessment of potential biases, ensuring fairness in data representation, and maintaining transparency in our analytical methods. We understand that while the data itself may not include personal information, there could still be downstream consequences associated with our analysis or predictive modeling. Thus, we aim to avoid overgeneralizing our claims. Our group will make sure we are transparent and honest about our data methods, data sources, and potential limitations and biases in our analysis and ensure there is no downplaying or exaggeration of our results despite our own biases. Our group will make certain there are no misinterpretations or misinformation in our research that could lead to false analysis.\n"
