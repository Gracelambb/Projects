## Project 1: Default Risk Prediction
**Code can be found at:** Default_Risk_Code.zip \
**Final Paper:** Default_Risk_Prediction_Models_Final_Paper.pdf

- Effectively handled the imbalance distribution of classes in the loan application dataset using techniques such as adjusting class weights and applying ensemble methods.
- Enhanced model performance through a combination of forward selection and recursive feature elimination. Utilized techniques such as pipelining, stacking, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve a roc_auc score improvement of 0.13.

## Project 2: Predict Price of Airbnb Listings
**Code can be found at:** Predict Price of Airbnb Listings.ipynb

-  Applied NLP techniques such as TF-IDF and Bag of Words to analyze text data and extract new features from it.
-  Built an ensemble model using the stacking technique, which combined LightGBM, Gradient Boost and Random
Forest Regressor, optimized by using grid search and cross-validation.

## Project 3: Interactive Data Visualization
**Code can be found at:** DSC_106_Interactive_data_Vis \

## Project 4: League of Legends Hypothesis Test and Prediction Project
**Code can be found at:** league_hypothesis _test.ipynb and league_prediction_model.ipynb

- Justified issues in the data generating process and utilized the mechanisms of missingness to wrangle data.
- Designed a hypothesis test to draw conclusions about the significance of the support role in League of Legends.
- Constructed a random forest model to predict the outcome of a game based on the first 10 minutes.
