        <h1 class="title2">An Interactive Guide to US Education Costs</h1>
        <h2 class="author">By Grace Lam</h2>
        <br>
        Educational costs have been rising from year to year, and this has
        posed concerns to many students planning to study in the United States.
        Students who want to pursue undergraduate studies in the US might 
        consider the expected expenses of their education as a key factor 
        in selecting universities. Therefore, in this project, I will provide a 
        quick guide to help students understand educational costs from state to state,
        as well as for different educational lengths and types.

    <h3>Lets first take a look at the undergraduate expenses in the US from year 2013 to 2021:</h3>
<div id="p1">

    As we can see, there is a general increase in the average expenses
    for undergraduate education in the United States from 2013 to 2021.
     In fact, there is an over 35 percent increase from 2013 to 2021.
      With increasing undergraduate expenses, it might be good to start 
      wondering if there is a significant difference across states or a 
      difference between educational lengths.

        <h3>Now lets compare across states...</h3>
        Feel free to click on the buttons below to take a closer look at the 
        undergraduate expenses overall, for 4-year or for 2-year education.
        <div id="p2">
            <br><br>
            <button id="button_overall">Overall</button>
            <button id="button_4year">4 year</button>
            <button id="button_2year">2 year</button>
        </div>
        <div id="plot2" class="center_plot"></div>
        The shade of blue indicates the expenses; the darker the color, 
        the more expensive it is. We can see that the map for the overall 
        undergraduate expenses by state is a lot lighter than that of the 
        4-year because 'overall' includes both 4- and 2-year programs. 
        A 2-year program is often cheaper because it usually consists of 
        community college or associate degrees.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now that you have a general idea of the undergraduate expenses 
        by state and by educational length, you can now play around 
        with the visualization below to compare your states of interest. 
        The size of the circles will be proportional to the expenses, 
        which will allow for a clear comparison. You can also hover 
        your mouse over the circles to see the specific values.
